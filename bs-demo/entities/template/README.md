The files contained in ./github_content and ./gitlab_content
were either supplied by default by backstage, or copied
over from https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-playground-utils/tree/main,
a repository which serves as an example of a good quality
GitHub repository. These files get inserted into repositories
made by backstage templates.

The templates written in template.yaml were written by Rowan Moss (rowan.moss@stfc.ac.uk).
One publishes a repository to GitHub, one publishes to GitLab, and one
publishes to both.
